## 🔒 Protect against attack vectors and Solidity Pitfalls

- Using Specific Compiler Pragma (0.8.4)
- Proper Use of Require, Assert and Revert 
- Use Modifiers Only for Validation 
- Checks-Effects-Interactions (Avoiding state changes after external calls)
- Re-entrancy
- Timestamp Dependence: I use block timestamps but the calculation interval is 30 days

## 🔐 Security

- SafeMath to avoid Integer Over/Underflow (SWC-101)
- Avoid txOrigin attack (SWC-115)
- Using new Solidity (SWC-102)
